# Hospitality-Revenue-Occupancy-Analytics
## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hospitality revenue, occupancy, and customer behavior for a multi-property hotel chain. Using Power BI, MySQL, and Excel, the analysis uncovers seasonal demand patterns, customer segmentation insights, and key revenue trends to support data-driven pricing and operational decisions.

The dataset consists of 1.8M+ hotel booking and revenue records, transformed into interactive dashboards for real-time performance monitoring.
